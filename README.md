# Line-Calculus-on-Hyperboloids
On the angular control of laser reflections by means of line calculus on hyperboloids.

The folder "Points on boards" contain the raw datapoints. These are the 3D coordinates of the intersections of the reflected laser beams with the detection planes.
The folder "Lines" contain all the train and test sets, as well as all the predicted lines by both the Gaussian proces and our (the algebraic) method.
